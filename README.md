# Who I am

I am a versatile developer, highly adaptable and able to work in many different contexts, with more than 20 years of professional experience.

I am especially proficient at:

- analyzing customer and/or business needs and designing a corresponding software architecture ;
- handling large volumes of data and improving software performances ;
- creating and improving data models (SQL, NoSQL);
- thinking out of the box, and bringing new solutions to the table.

I work exclusively in remote (GMT+1).  
Of course, in-person meetings are possible: I am physically located at La Ciotat (France), and can meet you anywhere, given reasonable meetings frequency and travel times.

I currently favor the following programming languages: Node.js, Flutter.  
I can also work on projects written in other languages, such as: C, Java, C#, Python, PHP, ...
