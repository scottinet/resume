# Overview

I am currently a lead developer and software architect at [Kuzzle](http://kuzzle.io), and I have about 20 years of professional experience.  
I can work either in either La Ciotat, Toulon, Aix-en-Provence or Marseille (France), their surrounding areas, or remotely.

I *largely* favor remote working, because I want to lower my carbon footprint as much as possible. Do not worry: I am as much productive, if not more, working on my own desk at home, and I still gladly and efficiently do collaborative work with my coworkers.

I'm proficient in C and Node.js, I can easily work on existing projects written in Java, C++, C#, Python, Go or PHP, and I can learn new languages very quickly.

I favor architectures focusing on modular, easy-to-understand and maintainable code, aiming at lowering maintenance costs, while favoring the addition of new features.
You may browse [my own github repository](https://github.com/scottinet) and the [kuzzle one](https://github.com/kuzzleio), to check if my coding style and skills match your expectations.

Other skills that I have:

* I am a fast learner, able to quickly grasp new paradigms, languages and practices
* I am *very* curious, relentlessly asking questions, and unable to quit an issue until I fully grasp everything it implies
* I have architectured applications, data models and codes (object-oriented or not), and I love doing that
* I naturally offer my help to other team members, or train them when they ask me to
* I helped design and optimize applications storage in SQL databases, as well as a large datawarehouse
* I managed a team for about 5 years

# What I am looking for

Above all, what I need are challenges.  


When I bang my head on my desk on a hard to track, subtle bug occuring randomly, I feel like entering the ring.  
And when I swear out loud about a performance issue that needs a new algorithm or a new approach to be addressed, I feel like a kid in a candy store.  


Give me routine and I get bored, and I lose my motivation. 


I would like to work for a company with a modern/Agile mindset, where people actually spend their time collaborating, communicating, working, improving, teaching and innovating.  

And if you are not there yet, but are really motivated to put these practices in place, then I can help with that too.

# Experiences

## 03/2015 - Now: Lead Developer/Software Architect (Kuzzle)

I am one of the lead developer and architect behind [Kuzzle](http://kuzzle.io).


Kuzzle is an open-source, installable, generic and all-purpose back-end. It is now heavily leaning toward the IoT market, handling anything from tracked logistic containers, to smart construction sites or entire smart cities.


* I co-designed and I was the only developer of [Koncorde](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koncorde), Kuzzle's real-time matching engine
* I am one of the main developers of Kuzzle's core. A few features that I designed and developed: network layers, network protocol plugin system, overload-protection mechanism, HTTP router, cluster synchronization, ...
* I led key architecture proposals, such as our modular architecture, our plugin system, and many others
* I constantly improved Kuzzle's memory consumption and overall performances
* I helped design and develop Kuzzle's SDKs in Javascript (browser + Node.js), Android, C# and Go
* I participated to the product's roadmap, and pushed a few strategic, business-oriented proposals

_Environment:_ Node.js, C, C++, Java, C#, Go

## 10/2010 - 03/2015: IT Manager (Natixis)

As a manager, I had to help my new team making a BI application work. That application was at first used by a few traders to navigate through simulation data generated by a computer grid:

* my team and I stabilized, overhauled and homogenized the application and its database storage, allowing it to absorb approx. 20 millions lines of data per day
* the application then grew to absorb new data, ten times that initial volume (approx. 200 millions lines per day), and a lot more users were using it daily, without knowing anything about the enormous quantity of data they were manipulating daily
* I promoted collaboration, sense of initiative and the right to make mistakes. My belief is that complex problems often require daring, out-of-the-box solutions, and those can only be obtained if failure is an accepted outcome: what matters is how failure can be contained and mitigated, which goes with good customer support
* I made sure my team communicated constantly and honestly with clients and business analysts. This allowed establishing trust in our relationship, a better understanding of each others constraints, and mutual efforts to improve how we worked

Since mid-2013, I also had to manage a critical front-office application, whose reports were followed by the bank top management:

* I hired a new team to maintain that application, and I had to make sure that the transfer was as seamless as possible for our users
* Over time, I also changed the way we worked with our users and business analysts to make them actors of our development processes, with the same benefits I already obtained with my other team

_Environment:_ Sybase IQ, SQL Server (+ BI tools), C#

## 02/2008 - 10/2010: Developer/Software Architect (Natixis)

Hired by Natixis, I was assigned to a front-office project team, whose role was to implement and deploy significant projects for traders.  
My first assignment was to deploy a continuous integration environment (see the previous experience below), and that task involved cleaning the code base, creating tools over the already existing code managing products, and training the support and project teams.

Along with other business projects (mainly involving financial stress tests), I also contributed to the idea, design and coding of a generic production monitoring system, primarily aimed at reducing grid computing maintenance costs. Its uses has since been generalized to other production activities.

_Environment:_ C++, PERL, Sybase ASE, Misys Summit, Java 

## 03/2006 - 02/2008: IT Consultant (BTD Consulting => Natixis)

After the merging of Ixis CDC and Natexis Banques Populaires, my IT consulting contract has been prolongated for another three years.  
I worked full time for a front-office support team, doing trader support, software stabilization and improvements.  
After studying the integration and deployment workflow, I decided that it could be largely improved, and I proposed a migration plan, complete with tools deployment, server infrastructure, team training and benefits analysis.  
My plan was approved, and I was able to make it happen after I was hired by Natixis.

_Environment:_ C++, PERL, Sybase ASE, Misys Summit

## 05/2003 - 03/2006: IT Consultant (BTD Consulting => Natexis Banques Populaires)

As an IT consultant, I had to stabilize and improve a middle-office application used to consolidate data between trader desks and accounts department.  
I decided to industrialize the more costly processes and to overhaul the application's data model, drastically reducing the time needed to maintain and to improve the software.

My actions made the software simple enough that I was able to train a junior employee to take my place, allowing myself to work part time with another team, doing software support for a front-office software used by traders.

_Environment:_ C, PERL, Sybase ASE, Misys Summit

## 03/2003 - 05/2003: IT Consultant (BTD Consulting => Bouygues Construction)

Short IT consulting contract, where I helped local teams with a payroll software migration.

_Environment:_ PERL (self-taught)


## 01/2001 - 01/2003: IT Consultant (BTD Consulting => BNP Paribas)

As an IT consultant, I had to maintain a back-office software, used to track the activity of traders for the milanese branch of the bank.  
I had to fix, stabilize and improve the software, as well as its SQL data model.
I also improved the development workflow by adding a source control software and static code analysis.

_Environment:_ C, Sybase ASE

## 03/2000 - 09/2000: On-the-job training (INRA)

Working for the French National Institute for Agricultural Research, I helped maintain and upgrade a financial report generator.

_Environment:_ C++
