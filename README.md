(work in progress)

# Overview

I'm currently a lead developer at [Kuzzle](http://kuzzle.io), and I have over 16 years of professional experience.  

Here is what I think my current level is in languages I know:

* I can build new projects from scratch: C, Node.js
* I'm able to work on existing projects: Java, C++, Python, Go
* I've worked with those: C#, PERL, PHP

My coding style focuses on writing easy-to-understand, maintainable code, and I like to follow a few principles to achieve that goal, most prominently: [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself), and [The Boyscout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule)  
Feel free to browse the [github repositories](http://github.com/scottinet) I worked on to check if my coding style and skills match your expectations.

Other skills that I have:

* I'm a fast learner, able to quickly grasp new paradigms, languages and practices
* I naturally offer my help to other team members, or train them when they ask me to
* I've helped design and optimize applications storage in SQL databases
* I've managed a team for about 5 years to build a business intelligence project 
* I know how to speak to customers, even difficult ones

# Where I am located

I currently live near Montpellier, France. I'm looking for a job either in Montpellier or its surrounding area, and I'm also open to work remotely.

# How to keep me motivated

Above all, what I need are challenges.  
When I bang my head on my desk on a hard to track, subtle bug occuring randomly, I feel like entering the ring.    
When I swear out loud about a performance issue that needs a new algorithm or a new approach to be addressed, I feel like a kid in a candy store.  
And I absolutely love exchanging ideas with other teammates about an application's design, its architecture, or what new features it should have and how those can be implemented.


Another key to my motivation is that I need my successes and my errors to be recognized as they are.  
No more.  
And no less either.  
This is important to me as it makes me feel like a part of a team, and not just a random employee "only doing what he's paid for".


What I do not want: being a manager again.  
Past collaborators told me they liked having me as a manager, and it seems that I wasn't bad at it. But "not bad" just doesn't cut it for me. I now have enough experience to know that I lack some of the necessary skills to be what I think is a truly good manager.
